    <h2>I'm a WebBaby in training and we are under RED ALERT.</h2>
    <p>WebBaby got my life on track after an era of aimless creativity.</p>
    <p>After graduating high school in 2011 and working at St. Luke's Hospital by day and the local filmmaking community by night, I helped develop the pitch, pilot, and sizzle reel for what would become HGTV's <i>Boise Boys</i>. Focus was then shifted onto a semi-autobiographical comedy series tiled <i>Banned in Boise</i> that centered on a group of passionate filmmakers trying to retain their indie spirit while competing against a major production company. This project was created, written, pitched, and produced as a PlayStation Original Series pilot for the PlayStation Emerging Filmmakers Program.</p>

      <h6>Pictured: Max before abandoning his successful hockey career in 2004.</p></h6>
    <p>In 2019, the pivot was made from filmmaking into my long-beloved world of interactive media. Working with my fellow WebBabies, I'm currently in the process of shifting my production company, White Font, from a film-focused group into a Boise-based game development studio. </p>
