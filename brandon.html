    <h2>I'm an average webbaby.</h2>
    <p>Long inspired by film and games, I initially began writing screenplays whilst starting at Boise State University in the Fall of 2011. By the time I had started in the Games, Interactive Media and Mobile program at BSU, I had dropped out of college, become a supervisor for a team of anesthesia techs in Idaho's largest metropolitan hospital, worked as a co-creator on a comdey pilot for Playstation, and gotten married.  </p>
    <p>In the mid 2010's, fellow Web Baby Max Cannon and I sucessfully pitched a television show called <i>Banned In Boise</i> to studio heads at Sony Playstation. While the process of writing, shooting, and being a part of the release of our own television show was a high point in my life, after the buzz and ultimate shut down of the project, I decided to reengage myself with education once more and pursue game development.</p>
    <p>When I'm not being an active Web Baby, or working at the hospital, I spend my time working out, reading, gaming, walking my dog and spending time with my wife.</p>
