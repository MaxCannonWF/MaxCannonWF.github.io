      <h2>I'm the <b class="OwenSparkles">✧･ﾟ: *</b> <em id="OwenBaby">baby</em> <b class="OwenSparkles">*:･ﾟ✧</b> of WebBaby.</h2>
      <p>I've been playing video games for as long as I remember, but everything changed when I was introduced to PC gaming through Valve's Team Fortress 2 in 2009. I continued to play other Valve games such as Counter Strike: Source, Portal 2, and Left 4 Dead. Valve's titles made me realize video games could be so much more, and from then on, I knew I wanted to be a video game developer.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, in the small, nontechnical town of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, my dream was viewed as ridiculous and impossible. Because of this, I spent 10 years of my life having no idea what I wanted to do. I latched onto Computer Science, but quickly failed out due to a lack of drive, which later was found out to be caused by my diagnosis of <b class="OwenDepression">genetic depression.</b> </p>
      <p>During the lowest point of my life, my parents told me about GIMM through word of mouth. The description alone reignited that drive to want to do things again. Ever since, I have been working hard to achieve the life-long dream of being a game developer, and I am loving every bit of it.</p>
