    <h2>I'm an old WebBaby.</h2>
    <p>I graduated high school in 2001. I spent the next couple years working a couple of jobs that weren't exactly interesting. Then, I went to ITT Tech in 2004 and got an Associate's degree in Multimedia. After that I worked as a web/graphic designer for a few years until the "great recession" hit. In need of money to pay my rent and outrageous student loans, I decided to join the Navy.</p>
    <p>In the Navy I was a Mass Communication Specialist, which means I did mostly public affairs, photography, and journalism. But in the Navy you are a sailor first, so I spent most of my time swabbing decks and standing watches. But I picked up a couple of decent skills and had some incredible and unique experiences, some of which I am happy to share, some of which should never be shared.</p>
    <p>I got out of the Navy in 2016 and got a job at Idaho Power as a web designer. I had a little bit of a hard time adjusting to that job after the Navy and wasn't ever engaged in the work, so I decided to go back to school to learn how to make something more interesting. Now here I am.</p>
