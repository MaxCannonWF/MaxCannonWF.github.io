      <h2>I'm a frickin' WebBaby.</h2>
      <p>Born in Finland, the viking lifestyle was calling me. Ready to spend my days as a heavy metal legend and my nights in a suana, fate said otherwise as my family moved to Russia when I was only 3 months old. Having to adapt to the Russian lifestyle, I joined the mafia. They put me in charge of watching over Helga, their pet bear. I look back fondly on the days of splitting 4 bottles of vodka with Helga, but eventually I had to put my Russian mafia family behind. After 2 years in Russia, my parents told me that we had a family of our own in Belgium and that we would move there to join them. I decided to settle down and live a humble Belgian lifestyle of running a waffle stand and competing in bicycle races. But as history repeats itself, after 4 years my family moved again. This time we moved to Pocatello, Idaho.</p>
      <p>I stayed in Pocatello, graduating high school in 2016. Since then I have been chasing the dream to become a game designer. Spending 2 years at the University of Idaho in their Virtual Technolody and Design program. It wasn't to my liking, so I looked elsewhere, eventually finding the GIMM program here at BSU.</p>
      <p>I'm also pretty good at Smash Bros.</p>
